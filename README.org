* replication.el

This is a nearly trivial Git-based replication system for Emacs.

To use it:

- Create the directory ~$USER/replicated/~ on at least two different
  machines.

- On machine A, run ~git init $USER/replicated~.

- On machine B, use ~git clone~ to clone A's ~replicated/~.

- On each machine, make sure that ~replication.el~ is on your
  `load-path'.

- On each machine, add this to your ~.emacs~:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'replication)
(setq replication-directory "~/replicated")
(add-hook 'after-save-hook 'replication-save-hook)
#+END_SRC

After that, editing an existing file in ~replicated/~ on any of the
machines will automatically cause the file to be committed to Git,
after which ~git push~ will be run.

You'll still have to run ~git pull~ to retrieve updates from other
machines.
